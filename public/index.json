Fakeout is a term used in technical analysis to refer to a situation in which a trader enters into a position in anticipation of a future transaction signal or price movement, but the signal or movement never develops and the asset moves in the opposite direction.\nUsing Fakeouts When a breakout occurs, a lot of traders will enter a long/short position (in the example above - a long). Those traders will set their stop-losses around the price of the breakout (in the example - below the support line, the red area).\nIn the case that the breakout was actually a fakeout, when the price reverses, it\u0026rsquo;s going to hit all of the traders\u0026rsquo; stop-losses which will consequently move the price even more.\nEntry Our entry point would be at the bottom/top of the candle that broke the support/resistance line.
